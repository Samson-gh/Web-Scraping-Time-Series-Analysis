Web Scraping + Time Series Analysis

Finding high quality data to perform data science and analysis on can be a challenge. Sites like kaggle can provide fantastic opportunities to those who want easy access to large structured datasets, but vast amounts of data can be found on webpages that can often be overlooked. Web Scraping offers the ability to tap into this ecosystem to gain access to information that would otherwise be unavailble or difficult to procure with relative ease.

This project is a simple and superficial example of pulling data from a webpage and performing some sort of analysis on said data. In this case I will request a handful of pages from espn holding weekly player statistics from the 2022 NFL season. The plan is to organize, clean, and perform some analysis on a fantasy score that will be added onto the data based on a standard fantasy scoring system.
